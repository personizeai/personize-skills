# Skill: Personize Code Pipelines

Build production-ready Go-To-Market automation pipelines using **Trigger.dev** for durable task execution and the **Personize SDK** for AI-powered memory, context, and personalization.

Every pipeline is TypeScript. Every pipeline is testable. Every pipeline uses the Personize SDK as the core intelligence layer.

---

## When to Use This Skill

- Someone describes an agent or automation they want built — "I want an agent that monitors leads and sends follow-ups"
- Developer wants to build GTM automation (outbound, inbound, enrichment, reply handling)
- Developer asks for "durable workflows", "background tasks", or "scheduled pipelines"
- User wants AI-powered email sequences that learn from every interaction
- User wants to combine CRM data + web research + Personize memory for personalization
- User needs self-scheduling follow-ups that survive server restarts
- User says "build me an agent that..." or "I want to automate..."

**You handle two types of users:**
- **Developers** who know TypeScript → give them scaffold + pipeline templates, they customize
- **Non-developers** who describe what they want → interview them, design everything, write the code, deploy it, iterate based on their feedback

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- User wants no-code/visual workflows → use the **no-code-pipelines** skill instead
- User only needs a one-time data import → use the **entity-memory** skill with `batch-memorize`
- User wants to plan/design before building → use the **solution-architect** skill first, then come here to build

## The Core Pattern: AI Agent as Pipeline

Personize SDK is the **memory + governance layer**. You can use it with:
- **Personize AI** (`ai.prompt()`, `agents.run()`) — built-in, simplest
- **Any LLM** (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Gemini, local models) — bring your own

### Option A: Personize AI with Built-in Tools
```typescript
// Built-in tools (recall, memorize, smart_guidelines, guidelines, etc.)
// are available by default.
const result = await personize.ai.prompt({
  prompt: `Research ${email} and write a personalized cold email.`,
  outputs: [{ name: "email_subject" }, { name: "email_body" }],
  memorize: { email, captureToolResults: true },
  // tier: 'basic' | 'pro' (default) | 'ultra' — selects curated model + credit rate
  // openrouterApiKey: '...' — BYOK (Pro/Enterprise): 10 cr base + 10 cr/extra min
  // model + provider: requires BYOK (openrouterApiKey). Without BYOK, use tier.
});

// result.data.text — cleaned response (output markers stripped)
// result.data.outputs.email_subject — extracted structured output
// result.data.outputs.email_body — extracted structured output
// result.data.metadata.toolResults — tool return values (always present)
```

> **`outputs`**: The server instructs the LLM to wrap each named deliverable in `<output name="...">` XML markers, then extracts and JSON-parses them server-side. The `text` field contains the cleaned response; structured data goes in `outputs`.

> **`captureToolResults: true`**: Memorizes tool return values (e.g. web search results, enrichment data) alongside extracted outputs. Does NOT change the response body — only affects what gets memorized. Meta tools (`smart_guidelines`, `recall_pro`, etc.) are excluded from capture.

> **MCP Tools:** External MCP servers (Tavily, HubSpot, Zapier, etc.) connected via the [Personize dashboard](https://app.personize.ai) are automatically available to the AI during prompt execution.

> **Attachments:** Send images, PDFs, or documents for multimodal analysis. Provide base64 `data` or a `url`:
> ```typescript
> const result = await personize.ai.prompt({
>   prompt: "Extract key data from this invoice and create a contact record.",
>   attachments: [
>     { name: "invoice.pdf", mimeType: "application/pdf", url: "https://..." },
>   ],
>   outputs: [{ name: "invoice_data" }, { name: "contact_info" }],
>   memorize: { email: extractedEmail, captureToolResults: true },
> });
> ```
> Supported: `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `application/pdf`, `text/plain`, `text/csv`, `text/html`, `text/markdown`, `application/json`. Max 10 attachments, 20 MB each, 50 MB total. In multi-step `instructions[]`, attachments are sent with the first step only.

### Option B: YOUR LLM + Personize Memory (Bring Your Own LLM)
```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { personize } from "./lib/personize";

// 1. Recall from Personize memory
const digest = await personize.memory.smartDigest({ email, include_properties: true, include_memories: true });

// 2. Get org guidelines from Personize
const guidelines = await personize.ai.smartGuidelines({ message: "outbound email guidelines" });

// 3. YOUR LLM generates content
const completion = await new OpenAI().chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: `Guidelines:\n${guidelines.data.compiledContext}` },
    { role: "user", content: `Write email to ${email}.\n\nContext:\n${digest.data.compiledContext}` },
  ],
});

// 4. Memorize the result back into Personize
await personize.memory.memorize({ email, content: `[SENT] ${completion.choices[0].message.content}`, speaker: "outbound" });
```

### Option C: YOUR LLM with Personize as Function Tools
```typescript
import { OPENAI_TOOLS, executePersonizeTool } from "./lib/personize-tools";

// Give your LLM Personize tools — it decides when to recall, memorize, check guidelines
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Write a follow-up for john@acme.com" }],
  tools: OPENAI_TOOLS,  // personize_recall, personize_memorize, personize_smart_guidelines, personize_smart_digest
});

// Execute tool calls via Personize SDK
for (const tc of response.choices[0].message.tool_calls || []) {
  await executePersonizeTool(tc.function.name, JSON.parse(tc.function.arguments));
}
```

See `reference/personize-sdk-reference.md` for full BYOLLM documentation and `pipelines/outbound/cold-outreach-byollm.ts` for all three patterns in action.

## Action: BUILD — Full Lifecycle Agent Creation

When the user describes what they want (instead of asking for a specific pipeline template), guide them through the full lifecycle. This is the primary action for non-developer users and for developers who want a faster path.

### Phase 1: Interview (2-5 questions)

Understand the agent's purpose. Ask conversationally, not as a checklist:

1. **"What should this agent do?"** — the core automation (monitor leads, send outreach, handle replies, generate reports)
2. **"What data does it work with?"** — CRM, email, product usage, web research, manual input
3. **"Where should results go?"** — Email, Slack, CRM update, webhook, dashboard
4. **"What rules should it follow?"** — Brand voice, compliance, competitor policy, approval workflows
5. **"How often should it run?"** — Real-time (webhook trigger), scheduled (daily/hourly cron), or event-driven (on new lead, on reply)

If the user gives a broad description like "I want an agent that handles my leads," ask follow-up questions. If they give a detailed spec, skip to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Design

Based on the interview, design four things before writing any code:

**1. Schema** — What collections and properties does this agent need?
```typescript
// Example: Lead monitoring agent
await client.collections.create({
    collectionName: 'Lead',
    properties: [
        { propertyName: 'engagement_score', type: 'number', description: 'AI-assessed engagement level 0-100' },
        { propertyName: 'lifecycle_stage', type: 'options', options: ['new', 'enriched', 'contacted', 'engaged', 'qualified'] },
        { propertyName: 'last_outreach_date', type: 'date', description: 'Date of most recent outbound communication' },
        { propertyName: 'enrichment_status', type: 'options', options: ['pending', 'enriched', 'failed'] },
    ],
});
```

**2. Governance** — What rules constrain the agent?
```typescript
await client.guidelines.create({
    name: 'Outbound Email Rules',
    content: 'Professional but approachable. Max 150 words. Reference a specific fact about the recipient. Never mention competitors by name. Include clear CTA. No emails on weekends.',
    triggerKeywords: ['email', 'outreach', 'outbound', 'cold', 'follow-up'],
    tags: ['outbound', 'email', 'brand-voice'],
});
```

**3. Pipeline architecture** — Which pipeline template(s) to combine, what trigger, what schedule.

**4. Integration map** — Which external services and credentials are needed (CRM, email, enrichment).

Present this design to the user for confirmation before writing code.

### Phase 3: Implement

Write the complete pipeline code:

1. **Copy the scaffold** as the project base
2. **Create the schema** — `collections.create()` calls for all entities
3. **Create governance variables** — `guidelines.create()` calls for all rules
4. **Write the pipeline** — combine patterns from existing templates, customized to their data model and business logic
5. **Set up integrations** — configure env vars and auth for external services
6. **Add monitoring** — include a daily digest pipeline that reports results to Slack or email

Every pipeline MUST follow: **Recall → Contextualize → Act → Memorize → Schedule**

### Phase 4: Deploy

Walk the user through deployment. Read `reference/deploy.md` for the full deployment guide.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in API keys

# 3. Test locally
npx trigger.dev@latest dev

# 4. Test with a single record
# Trigger the task manually via Trigger.dev dashboard or CLI

# 5. Deploy to production
npx trigger.dev@latest deploy
```

### Phase 5: Monitor & Iterate

After deployment, help the user evaluate results and improve:

1. **Check initial results** — "How do the first few outputs look? Any issues?"
2. **Adjust governance** — If tone is wrong, update the governance variable. No code change needed.
3. **Adjust prompts** — If the AI misunderstands the task, refine `instructions[]` or `prompt` text
4. **Adjust pipeline logic** — If the workflow order is wrong, restructure the pipeline
5. **Redeploy** — `npx trigger.dev@latest deploy`
6. **Repeat** until the user is satisfied

**Common iteration patterns:**

| User Feedback | What to Change |
|---|---|
| "Emails are too formal" | Update governance variable (brand voice) |
| "It's emailing people we already talked to" | Add recall check before outreach (dedup) |
| "I want Slack alerts for high-priority leads" | Add Signal/notification step after scoring |
| "It's too slow" | Use `fast_mode: true` on smartRecall, reduce `token_budget` |
| "Some outputs feel hallucinated" | Add `evaluate: true` with `evaluationCriteria`, tighten governance |
| "I want it to also update HubSpot" | Add HubSpot API call after generation step |

## Pipeline Customization Guide

When generating or customizing a pipeline, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the GTM motion
- **Outbound** — we initiate contact (cold email, sequence, signal-triggered outreach)
- **Inbound** — they initiate contact (form, demo request, reply)
- **Enrichment** — data flows in from external sources into Personize memory
- **Signals** — monitoring for triggers/events

### Step 2: Choose the trigger
- `task()` — triggered programmatically or via webhook
- `schedules.task()` — cron-based (daily sync, hourly monitor)
- Webhook endpoint → triggers a task via `myTask.trigger(payload)`

### Step 3: Wire the Personize SDK
Every pipeline should:
1. **Recall** — check what we already know (`memory.recall()` or via MCP tools)
2. **Contextualize** — get org guidelines (`ai.smartGuidelines()` or via MCP tools)
3. **Act** — generate content, score leads, draft replies (`ai.prompt()` or `agents.run()`)
4. **Memorize** — store the interaction (`memory.memorize()` or `memorize:` param)
5. **Schedule** — self-schedule follow-ups if needed (`wait.for()` or `.trigger({ delay })`)

### Step 4: Add app integrations
Use native SDKs. See `reference/channel-setup.md` for setup patterns for each app.

### Step 5: Deploy and test
```bash
npx trigger.dev@latest dev    # local testing
npx trigger.dev@latest deploy # production
```

## Constraints

> Keywords follow [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119): **MUST** = non-negotiable, **SHOULD** = strong default (override with stated reasoning), **MAY** = agent discretion.

1. **MUST** use the Personize SDK as the memory and governance layer in every pipeline -- because pipelines without memory lose context between runs and ignore organizational rules.
2. **MUST** follow the Recall → Contextualize → Act → Memorize → Schedule pattern in every pipeline -- because skipping steps produces ungoverned, context-blind, or non-learning automation.
3. **SHOULD** use native app SDKs (googleapis, @hubspot/api-client, jsforce, @slack/web-api) over generic HTTP wrappers -- because native SDKs handle auth refresh, pagination, and error codes automatically.
4. **SHOULD** use `ai.prompt()` with `memorize: { captureToolResults: true }` for generation tasks -- because it closes the feedback loop automatically without extra memorize calls.
5. **MAY** use any LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, local models) alongside Personize memory -- because the SDK is LLM-agnostic; the memory and governance layer works with any generation backend.

## Cost Estimates

### Per-pipeline execution costs (approximate)

| Pipeline | Trigger.dev | Personize | Apollo | Tavily | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cold outreach (1 lead) | ~$0.001 | ~$0.01 | 1-8 credits | 1 search | ~$0.02-0.05 |
| Multi-touch (3 steps) | ~$0.003 | ~$0.03 | 0 (already enriched) | 0 | ~$0.03 |
| Batch enrich (100 leads) | ~$0.05 | ~$0.50 | 100-800 credits | 100 searches | ~$2-5 |
| Daily signal monitor (50 accounts) | ~$0.02 | ~$0.10 | 0 | 50 searches | ~$0.60 |
| Email reply handler (1 reply) | ~$0.001 | ~$0.01 | 0 | 0 | ~$0.01 |

Trigger.dev: $0.0000169/sec (Micro machine). Personize: per plan. Apollo: $0.20/credit overage. Tavily: $0.01/search.

### Generate Tiers & Direct Providers

`ai.prompt()` supports tiered model selection and direct provider routing:

| Tier | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `basic` | 0.2 cr/1K | 0.4 cr/1K |
| `pro` | 0.5 cr/1K | 1.0 cr/1K |
| `ultra` | 1.0 cr/1K | 2.5 cr/1K |

1 credit = $0.01. Pass `tier` for curated model selection. Custom `model` + `provider` require BYOK (`openrouterApiKey`) — without it, the API returns 400. BYOK billing: 10 credits base + 10/extra minute (Pro/Enterprise plans).
