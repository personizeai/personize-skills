# Skill: Diagnostics

Verify setup and troubleshoot the Personize stack. Two modes:

- **VERIFY** — Proactive. Run after setting up memory, governance, pipelines, or workspaces to confirm they work.
- **FIX** — Reactive. Jump to the action that matches the symptom when something breaks.

---

## When to Use This Skill

**Verify mode:**
- Just finished memorizing data and want to confirm it's stored and recallable
- Just set up guidelines and want to confirm agents can see them
- Just wired a pipeline and want to run one record end-to-end
- Just set up a shared workspace and want to confirm agents can read/write
- Want to run a periodic health check

**Fix mode:**
- Recall returns irrelevant, empty, or noisy results
- Memorized data isn't being extracted correctly
- Guidelines aren't reaching agents or return wrong content
- Getting 429 rate limit errors or partial batch syncs
- Trigger.dev or n8n workflows are failing
- Shared workspace is going stale or agents aren't contributing

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Need to store data → use **entity-memory**
- Need to create guidelines → use **governance**
- Need to build a pipeline → use **code-pipelines** or **no-code-pipelines**
- Need to understand the architecture → use **solution-architect**

## Works With Both SDK and MCP

| Interface | How it works | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **SDK** (`@personize/sdk`) | Run verification scripts locally | Developers, CI/CD |
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) | Use `memory_recall_pro`, `ai_smart_guidelines` tools interactively | Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor |

## Quick Smoke Test

If the developer isn't sure what's wrong or just wants to verify everything works, run this:

```typescript
import { Personize } from '@personize/sdk';
const client = new Personize({ secretKey: process.env.PERSONIZE_SECRET_KEY! });

// 1. Auth — can we connect?
try {
  const me = await client.me();
  console.log(`✅ Auth: ${me.data.organization.name} (${me.data.plan.name})`);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('❌ Auth failed:', e.message);
  console.log('   → Check PERSONIZE_SECRET_KEY');
}

// 2. Memory — can we store and retrieve?
try {
  await client.memory.memorize({
    email: 'diagnostics-test@example.com',
    content: 'Test record for diagnostics. This person works at Acme Corp as a VP of Engineering.',
    enhanced: true,
  });
  const recall = await client.memory.recall({
    query: 'Who works at Acme Corp?',
    email: 'diagnostics-test@example.com',
  });
  console.log(`✅ Memory: ${recall.data.memories.length > 0 ? 'stored and recallable' : '⚠️ stored but not yet recallable (indexing may take 1-2 min)'}`);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('❌ Memory failed:', e.message);
  if (e.message.includes('429')) console.log('   → Rate limited. See FIX: RATE-LIMITS.');
}

// 3. Governance — can we fetch guidelines?
try {
  const guidelines = await client.ai.smartGuidelines({ message: 'test verification' });
  console.log(`✅ Governance: ${guidelines.data.compiledContext ? 'responding' : '⚠️ no guidelines set up yet'}`);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('❌ Guidelines failed:', e.message);
}

// 4. Digest — can we compile context?
try {
  const digest = await client.memory.smartDigest({
    email: 'diagnostics-test@example.com',
    include_properties: true,
    include_memories: true,
  });
  console.log(`✅ Digest: ${digest.data.compiledContext ? 'compiling context' : '⚠️ empty'}`);
} catch (e) {
  console.log('❌ Digest failed:', e.message);
}
```

### MCP equivalent

```
1. Call memory_store_pro with content "Test record. Works at Acme Corp as VP Engineering." and email "diagnostics-test@example.com"
2. Call memory_recall_pro with query "Who works at Acme Corp?" and email "diagnostics-test@example.com"
3. Call ai_smart_guidelines with message "test verification"
4. Confirm each returns data
```

Based on results, jump to the appropriate VERIFY or FIX action below.

## VERIFY Actions

Use after setting up a capability to prove it works.

| Action | When to Use | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **VERIFY-MEMORY** | After memorizing data — confirm it's stored and recallable | `reference/verify-memory.md` |
| **VERIFY-GOVERNANCE** | After setting up guidelines — confirm agents can see them | `reference/verify-governance.md` |
| **VERIFY-PIPELINE** | After wiring a pipeline — run one record end-to-end | `reference/verify-pipeline.md` |
| **VERIFY-WORKSPACE** | After setting up a shared workspace — confirm agents can read/write | `reference/verify-workspace.md` |
| **HEALTH-CHECK** | Ongoing — diagnose quality, performance, and coverage issues | `reference/health-check.md` |

---

## FIX Actions

Use when something is broken. Jump to the action that matches the symptom.

| Action | When to Use | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **BAD-RECALL** | Recall returns irrelevant, empty, or noisy results | `reference/bad-recall.md` |
| **BAD-EXTRACTION** | Memorized data isn't being extracted correctly | `reference/bad-extraction.md` |
| **GOVERNANCE-MISS** | Guidelines aren't reaching agents or return wrong content | `reference/governance-miss.md` |
| **RATE-LIMITS** | Getting 429 errors or partial batch syncs | `reference/rate-limits.md` |
| **PIPELINE-FAILURE** | Trigger.dev/n8n workflows failing or producing bad output | `reference/pipeline-failure.md` |
| **WORKSPACE-STALE** | Agents not contributing or workspace going stale | `reference/workspace-stale.md` |

## Constraints

> Keywords follow [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119): **MUST** = non-negotiable, **SHOULD** = strong default (override with stated reasoning), **MAY** = agent discretion.

1. **MUST** run the smoke test or appropriate verify action after every setup — because untested setups create false confidence and delayed failures.
2. **MUST** run diagnostic steps before suggesting fixes — because guessing wastes time and can introduce new problems.
3. **MUST** use real queries that match the developer's actual use case, not generic test strings — because verification with irrelevant queries can pass while real queries fail.
4. **SHOULD** show the developer the actual API response, not just pass/fail — because seeing the data builds understanding and catches quality issues.
5. **SHOULD** rank root causes by likelihood and check the most likely first — because systematic diagnosis is faster than shotgun debugging.
6. **SHOULD** verify the fix worked by re-running the failing operation — because a fix that doesn't resolve the symptom isn't a fix.
7. **SHOULD** clean up test data after verification — because leftover test records pollute memory and confuse downstream agents.
